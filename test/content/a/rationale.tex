\subsection{a}

The word ``area" presented by default as {\ssdefault area} is hardly
distinguishable from {\ssdefault oreo} (``oreo") which is why a typesetter may
decide to use one of the stylistic alternates for ``a" to produce
{\ssdefault{\ssone a}re{\ssone a}} (ss01),
{\ssdefault{\ssthree a}re{\ssthree a}} (ss03) or
{\ssdefault{\ssfour a}re{\ssfour a}} (ss04).

The ss02 and ss05 alternatives look more like ``dred" or ``drod", respectively
{\ssdefault{\sstwo a}re{\sstwo a}} (ss02) or
{\ssdefault{\ssfive a}re{\ssfive a}} (ss05)
which fails to improve legibility in this particular case.

The following sections discuss the stylistic alternates available for ``a" and
presents some cases where these alternates may prove effective.

\subsubsection{default {\ssdefault a}}

The default glyph for the letter ``a" harmonizes well with the overal design
language of the typeface but fails in avoiding ambiguity between letterforms
when this particular glyph is surrounded by letters as tall as the x-height and
with a rectangular profile as evident in the presentation of the word
\mbox{{\ssdefault area} (area)} which may easily be confused for ``oreo",
``drod'' or ``dred".
Conversely
\mbox{{\ssdefault train} (train)} or
\mbox{{\ssdefault transport} (transport)}
are rather clearly legible in part due to the distinctive shapes of the words
in question.

\subsubsection{{\ssone a}.ss01}
The ss01 stylistic alternative provides a horizontal stem that may at times be
misread as ``o" as in \mbox{\ssdefault m{\ssone aa}g} which represents
``maag" but could be misinterpreted as ``moog"; this glyph does aid in
maintaining the horizontal flow of a disinctive wordforms as evident in
%\mbox{{\ssdefault{\ssone a}rea} (area)},
\mbox{{\ssdefault d{\ssone a}ddy} (daddy)},
\mbox{{\ssdefault {\ssone a}lphabet} (alphabet)},
\mbox{{\ssdefault {\ssone a}lph{\ssone a}bet} (alphabet)},
\mbox{{\ssdefault {\ssone a}llah} (allah)} and
\mbox{{\ssdefault {\ssone a}ll{\ssone a}h} (allah)}

\subsubsection{{\sstwo a}.ss02}
provides a vertical stem that experience proves
to lead readers towards a ``d" as in
\mbox{{\ssdefault {\sstwo a}orta} (aorta)},
\mbox{{\ssdefault {\sstwo a}ort{\sstwo a}} (aorta)} or
\mbox{{\sstwo aero} (aero)}
until, for instance, a glyph with a taller ascender such as a ``d" or ``b"
preceeds or succeeds the glyph in question (``a") in order to provide
the reader with some visual context as evident in
\mbox{{\sstwo ability} (ability)},
\mbox{{\sstwo data} (data)},
\mbox{{\sstwo dragon} (dragon)}. Note that some readers will face
difficulty reading \mbox{{\sstwo land} (land)} or
\mbox{{\sstwo poland} (poland)} whereas \mbox{{\sstwo deutschland} (deutschland)} or
\mbox{{\sstwo wonderland} (wonderland)}
will be read with minimal effort which may be due to the initial
characters minimizing the search space for word possibilities and therefore
introducing a strong bias that depends less on the interpretation of the
individual letterforms for interpretation.

\subsubsection{{\ssthree a}.ss03}
sloped end is at times still confused for an
``o" and may potentially disrupt the flow of a formerly typeset text since
the width of this character is different and the right bearing has been
modified to account partially for the amount of negative space above the
extension

\subsubsection{{\ssfour a}.ss04}
similar to ss03 with the slope of the extension
inverted leading to a shape that is more reminiscient of ``a"
