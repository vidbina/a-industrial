\begin{abstract}
  The different stylistic sets of the font are presented in this preview in order to provide an indication of the alternative glyphs available for use.
  Considering that Industrial classifies as a Display type, there will be plenty of occasions where the default glyphs fail to produce wordshapes that allow for quick reading.

\section{Cases}
The following sections highlight some challenges with the typeface and proposes
some solutions which have been made available through alternate glyphs through
a number of stylistic sets.

\subsection{e}
The word {\ssdefault aeon} ("aeon") is hardly legible because the characters
are all very rectangular by shape as used to represent the character "o"
{\ssdefault o}. In some cases the shape of the word assists minimizing
ambiguity, a feat we can not really rely on in this case.

By exchanging the "e" for one of the alternatives as in {\ssdefault a\ssone{e}on} where "e" has
been replaced by an alternate from the first stylistic set (ss01), one may minimize
the ambiguity, however; due to the contraint of the grid the "familiar"
wordshape is distrupted, possibly complicating legibility.

\subsection{x}
{\ssdefault maximum}
