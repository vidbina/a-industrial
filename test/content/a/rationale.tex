\subsection{a}

The word ``area" presented by default as {\ssdefault area} is hardly
distinguishable from {\ssdefault oreo} (``oreo") which is why a typesetter may
decide to use one of the stylistic alternates for ``a" to produce
{\ssdefault{\ssone a}re{\ssone a}} (ss01),
{\ssdefault{\ssthree a}re{\ssthree a}} (ss03) or
{\ssdefault{\ssfour a}re{\ssfour a}} (ss04).

The ss02 and ss05 alternatives look more like ``dred" or ``drod", respectively
{\ssdefault{\sstwo a}re{\sstwo a}} (ss02) or
{\ssdefault{\ssfive a}re{\ssfive a}} (ss05)
which fails to improve legibility in this particular case.


The following glyphs are available for ``a":
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\ssdefault a} --- harmonizes best with the overal design language of
    the typeface but fails in minimizing ambiguity when surrounded by letters
    with a height close to the x-height and an overal rectangular profile a
    evident in the presentation of the word ``area", portrayed as
    {\ssdefault area}, which may easily be confused for other terms such as
    ``oreo" or even ``drod'' or ``dred"
  \item {\ssone a} (ss01): provides a horizontal stem that may at times be
    misread as ``o" as in {\ssdefault m{\ssone aa}g} which represents ``maag"
    but could be misinterpreted as ``moog"
  \item {\sstwo a} (ss02) --- provides a vertical stem that experience proves
    to lead readers towards a ``d" as in {\ssdefault {\sstwo a}orta} or
    {\ssdefault {\sstwo a}ort{\sstwo a}} until, for instance, a glyph with a
    taller ascender such as a ``d" or ``b" preceeds or succeeds the character
    in question (``a") in order to provide the reader with the visual context
    as evident in {\sstwo dragon} (dragon), {\sstwo dades} (dades) and
    {\sstwo ability} (ability)
  \item {\ssthree a} (ss03) --- sloped end is at times still confused for an
    ``o" and may potentially disrupt the flow of a formerly typeset text since
    the width of this character is different and the right bearing has been
    modified to account partially for the amount of negative space above the
    extension
  \item {\ssfour a} (ss04) --- similar to ss03 with the slope of the extension
    inverted leading to a shape that is more reminiscient of ``a"
\end{enumerate}
