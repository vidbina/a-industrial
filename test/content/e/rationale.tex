\subsection{e}
The word {\ssdefault aeon} (``aeon") is hardly legible because the characters
are all very rectangular by shape as used to represent the character ``o"
{\ssdefault o}. In some cases the shape of the word aids in minimizing
ambiguity, a feat we can not really rely on in this case.

By exchanging the ``e" for one of the alternatives as in
{\ssdefault a\ssone{e}on} where ``e" has been replaced by an alternate from the
first stylistic set (ss01), one may minimize the ambiguity, however; due to the
contraint of the grid the ``familiar" wordshape is distrupted, possibly
complicating legibility.
